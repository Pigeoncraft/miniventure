# miniventure
A remake of minicraft plus. After learning a bunch from the project, I wanted to start fresh, and try to make the best game possible. Let's see how it goes!

As of now, miniventure is still very new and doesn't have many features, but it's getting there. Here's a list of the major features it *does* have:

  - Random level generation based on perlin noise
  - Sprite animations
  - Tile overlap and connection sprites, so tiles fit together and mesh nicer.
  - Player interaction; you can damage tiles, and eventually break them. Some also hurt you.
  - Item drops; tiles drop items that you can pick up and put down elsewhere
  - Player death and respawning
  
Current goals include:
  - Making a menu / GUI system
  - Making a crafting system
  - Adding more mobs
  - Adding more tiles
  - Adding more items
  - Making a level system

Note: for those goals about adding stuff, it's sort of dependent on whether I have any art to depict said stuff... and I suck at art. :P So, if anyone out there is interested in making some sprites for the game, it would be greatly apprecieated. :D

You can find me on the [playminicraft discord server](https://discord.me/minicraft) pretty much daily. There's some other mods of minicraft there too; or you can take a look at the official [playminicraft website](https://playminicraft.com).
