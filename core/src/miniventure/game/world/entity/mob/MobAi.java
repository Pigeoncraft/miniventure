		The key component of MobAis is just that they will move by themselves.
		There are a couple different move patterns they could follow, however.
			Perhaps this would best be represented with an enum? An enum of MovementPatterns.
			We also need a way to determine which movement pattern to use at any given time, and switch between patterns.
			
			Here's a few standard patterns:
				- wandering. every so often, the mob picks a random direction, and walks for some duration.
				- follow player. pretty simple, the mob follows the player. Perhaps as long as the player is within a certain range.
				- run from player. reverse of above.
				
			and... that's about it, really...
