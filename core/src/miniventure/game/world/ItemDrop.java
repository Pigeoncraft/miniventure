		// in the end, a random number will be generated, 0 to 1, and an array of floats, one for each diff, will determine how many items are dropped.
		// the floats specify the upper bound in the 0-1 range
		
		First, just generate an integer between minCount and maxCount.
		Then, apply the bias. This is done by mapping the range from minCount to maxCount to the range of the specific difficulty.
		
		1/8 chance if 0 bias, for all diffs
		
		chance for those in the range, goes from 1/(total/numdiffs)% chance to 0% chance at the edges of the range.
		
		at 0.5 bias, it can go halfway up to the max at lowest difficulty.
		
		for lowest difficulty:
			- for bias of 0:
				chance of min = 1/total%
				chance of max = 1/total%
				min percent = 1/total% at all
				max percent = 1/total% at all
			- for bias of 0.5:
				chance of min = 
				chance of max = 
				min percent = 
				max percent = 
			- for bias of 1:
				chance of min = 
				chance of max = 
				min percent = 0% at half to total
				mid percent = 1/total% at quarter to total
				max percent = 1/(total/2)% at first
			
			ex. total = 8, bias = 1, diff = 1 of 4
			chance of values:
				1: 
				2: 
				3: 
				4: 
				5: 0
				6: 0
				7: 0
				8: 0
		
		There are two biases here: range bias and chance bias.
			Range bias literally removes options from the probability space.
				- at 0, all options are possible.
				- at 1, the options are only those that fit within the difficulty's fraction. So, the 1/numdiffs number of options (rounded up) in the order of the difficulty levels.
				- at 0.5, the possible options are half the number of difficulties. If there are 4 diffs and 8 options, then diff 1 will have options 1-4, diff 2 has 2-5, diff 3 has 4-7, diff 4 has 5-8.
				
				if 4 diffs and 3 options, and bias 1:
					d-1 has 
		
		At 0, all are possible with equal chance.
		At 0.5, all are possible, but 
		At 1, the min/max have shifted to only contain.
		
		
		
		
		peaceful = easy, but no evil mobs. It makes up, because you can't get the drops evil mobs have.
		difficulty is going to be a final choice; you choose when you create the world, like gamemode. But like gamemode, there will be a command to change the difficulty (as a "cheats" function, of course).
		
		so in essence, there are three difficulties.
		
		cow hide: 1, occ 2 in easy; 1 or 2 (eq. chance) in normal; 2, occ 1 in hard.

				- 0 means there is equal chance for any amount to be dropped on any difficulty.
