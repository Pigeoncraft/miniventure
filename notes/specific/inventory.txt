I think I'm going to try to make the inventory somewhat limited, rather than infinite. This will allow for a number of things, for example slots.

I could have a number of views, each one is a sort method, like recent, alphabetical, and type/category.


Other possibs:
A grid system, with a hotbar of 3-5 items. When the inventory key is pressed, the hotbar scrolls up to show the inventory. you can use a variety of controls to manipulate items in the inventory, but the key features are:
 - maintain the active hotbar slot, and have another highlighted slot in the inventory which 
 - "equip" items to the active hotbar slot, switching the items in the two slots
 - quick-move items between hotbar and

Goals for inventory:

	- limited
	- can use all controls with keyboard easily
	- maybe can use mouse too... but not necessary
	
	- has a hotbar with 3-5 items
	- has ~20 slots, maybe




About chests:
- they cannot be stored in your inventory unless they are empty. You can pick up filled chests, but you can't put them away into your inventory. one will just stay in your hands until you put it down.
- hitting one with an axe will break it, and all the items contained within will pop out. Maybe the item entity lifetime should be increased slightly..?
	- or, alternate idea, only allow empty chests to be destroyed.
