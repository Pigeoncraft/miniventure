Tiles can have the following properties:

- destructible; either has health, and causes damage particles to show, or one shot, and just goes away immediately.
  - has a tile that is shown when it is removed
  - conditions to remove
    - possibly preferred tools which do more damage
    - possibly has required tools that are needed to do any damage at all
        - if there are any req. tools, then any item that is not one of those tools has no effect. Possible message displayed.
    - possible custom condition to cause any damage; req. tool is a type of condition
  - item drops for when the tile is hurt. Can be dropped all at the end, or (later) bit by bit.

- interactable; able to specify an action to be taken when the player presses the interact key on the tile.

- walkable; default: true. Allows conditions to be checked about the entity to decide on result; also presets for always true or always false.

- Touch/continue touch/stop touch events: allows to do things relating to whether the player / an entity is on the tile or not.

- animation calls; if there are any special things to do when the tile is rendered, then it does them through this. Otherwise, it just renders the tile image.

- NOTE: tiles will not specify which tiles can be placed on them; rather, the item version will specify where it can be placed.


 When the player attacks, or attempts to interact, entities are checked first. If none are found, then the tile is allowed to be attacked / interact.
"Pick up" is not a command anymore. instead, furniture has health like other entities, but very little. Using the right tool allows it to be removed in one hit. Chests and such drop all their contents upon breaking. Push it to move it around.

Entities (and tiles) will display little health bars above their image, whenever they are attacked. The bar goes away after a couple seconds without being attacked, though the damage remains.

The items themselves specify the damage amount, but it is only passed to entities and tiles, and can be manipulated before "taking the damage", or ignored entirely.

Tools have durability too. It goes down as other tiles / entities say that the item was used.

Generally speaking, you can attack with anything. The item is only passed if it is a tool, otherwise it is not passed at all.

When attacking, if the held item is anything but a tool, it is automatically assumed that it does one damage, and the item is not even passed to the entity/tile, just null. If it is a tool, then it is queried for how much damage it does to things. Then, the tools is passed along with the damage. This is so other things can check for preferred tools, etc.

When interacting, the held item is "asked" if it can be used "intrinsically" without affecting a tile. Here things like potions and shirts and food can be used. If the item returns false, then we try to use the item on the entities and tile in front of the player. Each interaction has the chance to stop the chain, but it doesn't "use" the item unless the entity/tile tells the item itself (as the item is passed in the interaction).
