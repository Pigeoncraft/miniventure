hey, why not give the player an animation holding items? Or better, use the item's sprite, and just draw it in the player's hand, in each of the player's positions. It's a possible idea, but I'm skeptical.

Add a highlight to whatever the player *will* interact with if the attack or interact keys are pressed. Maybe overlay the sprite with a translucent white color.
